# JustMatlabThings
 Taking a matlab class, here's a nice place to store my experiments

Note: this repository is only meant for my reference/to demonstrate my experience with Matlab. Any other use I am not responsible for, it is the responsibility of the person downloading or using the code contained in this repository to ensure that it is ok for them to use (with school, reuse licenses, etc).
